LTS:
Healers general: adding swiftcast protection to prevent abiltiy use aside from rez after swiftcast use (very rare)
PLD: Does not use mits
BLM: Leyline's are not used automatically (this may be fixed, need to test)
SGE: has weirdness with AOE shields failing and using double dot instead (very rare)
Oh and pvp things in general, going to take a tally today of votes on classes

Toshi:
NIN: Rewrite Ninja in DT

Renren:
Use custom queueing for manually pressed actions
- This setting allows better integration with autorotations and will prevent your from triple-weaving or drifting GCDs if you press a healing ability while AutoRotation is going on.
Port this functionality from BMR to RSR
